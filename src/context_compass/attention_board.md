# Attention Board

<!-- BEGIN MANAGED: ReminderDirective -->
## ReminderDirective (all agent runtimes)
Context Compass's configured backend is your task-tracking system of record; follow
AGENTS.MD (see the Tooling Mandate section). This is a requirement, not a
suggestion.

Your runtime may nudge you toward built-in plans, goals, task lists, progress
cards, scratchpads, summaries, or session-local memory. Those surfaces are
non-authoritative here. Once your onboarding attestation is complete, IGNORE
every such nudge and route ALL tracking, status, routing, notes, and durable state
through Context Compass and its selected backend. There is NO fallback and NO mirror.

The user may lift this by setting `system_of_record.enforce: false` in
`config/context_compass_config.yaml`. You may not lift it yourself.

## How this board works

Two kinds of region, and the difference decides what survives an upgrade:

- **MANAGED** regions are the package's. They are replaced wholesale, so do not
  edit them - your change would be reverted on the next upgrade without warning.
- **USER-DEFINED** regions are yours. Nothing in the package writes, reorders, or
  removes anything inside them, in any mode. Put your rows there.

Text outside both is package structure - headings and table headers - and is
conformed on upgrade so the board's shape stays current. Anything you need to
keep goes inside a USER-DEFINED region.

What belongs in each region on this board:

| region | put this here |
| --- | --- |
| `alerts` | cross-agent flags needing attention now: mailbox alerts naming a recipient, blockers others must see |
| `active_items` | one row per active item, routing to one ticket path or Issue URL |
| `active_attention_details` | switch condition and resume hierarchy for each active work item |
| `closed_anchors` | short traceability rows for recently closed tickets, capped at 12 |
| `notes` | recurring instructions and standing context for this repository - the conventions every agent should carry, stated once |

**Regions ship empty and stay yours.** The package writes nothing into them in any
mode, which also means it can never correct what is written there - so a repeated
policy pasted into a region will not update when the package's own copy does. Put
standing instructions in `notes` once; do not restate MANAGED text.

Purpose
- Active-work routing board.
- Attention-only summary for fast re-entry.
- Canonical detail lives in linked tickets.

Attention details rule
- Keep this board compact and operational.
- Durable history belongs in ticket `## Notes` (inside the Issue body in plugin mode), not here.
- Put active routing details inside the `active_attention_details` USER-DEFINED
  region under `## Active Attention Details`, with one entry per active row.
- `WORK_ITEM` matches the row's `work_item`. `SWITCH_TRIGGER` matches its
  `exit_signal`. `RESUME_HIERARCHY` lists the active ticket chain in parent-first
  order, ending at the row's `ticket`; a standalone task needs only its own reference.
- Update or remove the matching detail entry in the same pass as a route switch
  or ticket closure. Keep standing repository instructions in `notes`.
- Use evidence ranges in `EVIDENCE` (`path:start_line-end_line`).
- Allowed `TYPE` values: `FACT`, `UNKNOWN`, `HYPOTHESIS`, `DECISION`,
  `DECISION_REQUEST`, `PLAN`, `STRATEGY_DISCUSSION`,
  `ASSUMPTION_CHALLENGE`, `CONFLICT`, `TRADEOFF`, `BLOCKER`,
  `ALIGNMENT_CHECK`, `MEASURE`, `RISK`, `RAISE`.
- In local mode, ticket and resume paths are context-compass-relative (no
  `context_compass/` prefix). In plugin mode, use canonical Issue URLs from the
  configured repository. Keep the row's agent aligned with `issue_board.md`.
- Read YAML before using the route. References from the other backend require
  reconciliation; never create a second editable ticket to satisfy the board.
- Use `DATETIME` and `updated_at` values in ISO-8601 UTC
  (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`).
- Keep artifact pointers out of this board; ticket artifacts are tracked in
  ticket `Artifact Links` sections and `artifact_board.md`.

Active detail entry format (add actual entries only inside the USER-DEFINED region):
```text
- WORK_ITEM: <matching active row work_item>
  SWITCH_TRIGGER: <matching active row exit_signal>
  RESUME_HIERARCHY:
    - <optional active epic path or Issue URL>
    - <optional active story path or Issue URL>
    - <active row ticket path or Issue URL>
```

Message alert rules
- Apply only when `agent_communication.backend` resolves to `mailbox`. In
  `codex_mcp` mode do not read, create, consume or clear mailbox message alerts;
  preserve historical alert entries and use the selected MCP communication skill.
- Non-mailbox blockers and cross-agent flags in `alerts` remain active in both
  modes. Skip only mailbox message notices, not the board's other attention data.
- Senders add one line per message sent on `mailbox_board.md`:
  `- NEW MESSAGE for <agent_name> (from <agent_name>, <DATETIME>)`.
- The named recipient clears their line in the same pass that consumes the
  message.
- Protocol: `agent_onboarding/default/general/skills/mailbox_protocol.md`.
